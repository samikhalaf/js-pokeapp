# The Vanilla JavaScript (ES6) Pok√©mon API üî•

## Introduction

Hi there! I'm Sami Khalaf, and I've developed this app with plain HTML + CSS + Javascript ES6.

This is mainly an exercise for me to polish my skills as a front-end developer, so I hope you check this out and enjoy it as much as I did programming it.

## Key features

- Plain JavaScript programming, no frameworks and no crazy libraries üí™üèø.
- Web Responsive design, with SCSS as main language, compiled into CSS. 
- Usage of BEM methodology for organising styles.
- Data consumed from the http://pokeapi.co/, as it's a great RESTful API with tons of features and really well managed data.

This app have mainly three parts:

1. The pokemon list, showed them as cards, numbered throughout many pages.
2. The Pok√©mon detail, displayed with custom modal windows.
3. The favorites button, where you can select any pokemon and list them in the favorites button. Favorites will be stored in a cookie, so the next time you visit the page you still have those saved. 

Cool new features for the future:

- Dark theme toggle button? That would be nice.
- Filter for the Pok√©mon main list, with types: fire, water, electric, etc.
